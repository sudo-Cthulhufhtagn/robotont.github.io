Overview
#############

ROBOTONT’s depth camera gives the ability to see like humans and map the entire environment in 3D. 
With its omnidirectional wheels, the platform is free to move in any direction at any time. 
Its transparent design, extendable hardware, and open source software offer plenty of room for customized extensions. 
ROBOTONT is based on the most widely used software in robotics development called ROS (Robot Operating System). 
ROS gives open access to the latest software packages that are already used by worldwide known companies, such as, Boeing, Siemens, ABB, etc., 
and connects the industry with leading research institutions...
