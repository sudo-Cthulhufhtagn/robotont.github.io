#. The robot driver subscribes to a specific type of messages called *velocity commands*. The standard name for this topic is :code:`/cmd_vel`. 

#. The message is of type :code:`geometry_msgs/Twist` and it's structure can be found from `ROS wiki <https://docs.ros.org/api/geometry_msgs/html/msg/Twist.html>`__.

#. To set and control the robot speed, the velocity commands need to be published continuously.
